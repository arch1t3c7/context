# Provider
[TODO]

# [TODO]

* Add services interfaces and make them available through environment context

* Should services come from providers? Perhaps a special feature type?

* TODO: Adjust code with "using"
*   Change asyncDispose back to being on the feature and not the promise
* Bring ENvronment provider class into this project
* Could we get rid of TServices in most contexts? And use something like ServiceFeatures?
